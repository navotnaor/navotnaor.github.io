In this design, your goal is to get the food without getting eaten.  You are safe when behind the black line, the food and predator are ahead.  
Use the up/down arrow keys to move up and down the screen.  
Move all the way to the bottom to escape (with or without the food).  
Your score improves by safely getting high food values.  
Being eaten is the worst result as you will get shocked and your score will be lowered by the reward amount.  
If you retreat your score doesn't change and there is no shock.  
There is a time limit per trial, but it isn't a tight timer.

Before we begin, you will calibrate the shock level with the experimenter to a level that is uncomfortable, but not painful. This level will be used throughout the experiment, which will last approximately 30 minutes.
If you have any questions before starting, please inform the experimeter.
