In this design, your goal is to get the food without getting eaten.  You are safe when behind the black line, the food and predator are ahead.  Use the up/down arrow keys to move up and down the screen.  Move all the way to the bottom to escape (with or without the food).  Your score improves by safely getting high food values.  Being eaten is the worst result as you will get shocked and your score will be lowered by the reward amount.  If you retreat your score doesn't change and there is no shock.  You cannot escape until you step past the safe line just a little.  There is a time limit per trial, but it isn't a tight timer.

To run the experiment:
    - double click on foraging.bat
    - fill out and submit the form (just put your directory id or something for subject ID)
    - maximize the game window
    - move over to room 125F
    - attach the 2 shocker things to your fingers (optional)
    - press enter to start
    - play the game
    - close the command window that popped up when you are done


You can press escape at any time to stop the experiment, logs will be saved automatically.

The startup form has many options, all of which have tooltips describing what they do.  Most of the options let you tune the design (be more or less challenging, less variable, etc).  When testing different settings I recommend using the debug option for Config Mode.  If you want to use the shocker, remember to set the Shock Mode to 'lab'.

You can save and load the settings, writes to a file called exp_info.pkl in the experiment folder.  If you find great new settings, please make a copy of that file and some notes about why it is better.

If using the joystick, use the two buttons on the back of the controller (index finger=up, middle finger=down).
